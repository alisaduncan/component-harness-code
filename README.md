# Using component harnesses to write tests and creating a test harness for a custom component

This is a tidy task todo list app with unit test examples. There are tests without using component harnesses and corresponding tests using component harnesses.
There's a custom UI component that has a test harness implementation along with tests for the test harness.

The code in this repo is used by [Tidying up your unit tests](https://alisaduncan.github.io/component-harness/) presentation.
